# zinedine

This is a small script that reorders a PDF file to zine format. This means that you can print the obtained PDF two pages per sheet, two-sided flipped on the short side, staple the printed pages together and you will hold in your hands a nicely formatted zine.

## Usage

```
python zinedine.py /path/to/input.pdf /path/to/output.pdf
```

## Prerequisites

1. Your PDF must
- be valid
- have at least one page
- have all pages in the same format

2. Install on your system
```
pip install pypdf2
```
